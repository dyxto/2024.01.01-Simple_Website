/
README.md

wanted to try out web development. did some research on the internet and then made a simple website. EASY SPEEDRUN!!

>index.html

this is the "main" page to the website. 
the informational content has been pulled from wikipedia.
linked content was added and formatted by me.

>anotherfile.html

self-explanatory: wanted to learn how to link to another html file.
original idea: was thinking of a html text browser game where you can progress by clicking links to the next page of content.

>style.css

here i added some style for the main page. i did add in-file css for some parts though.

>scripts/main.js

wanted to see how i could implement javascript into the website.
i followed a simple guide.

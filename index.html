        <h2>History</h2>

        <p><b>Pre-debut</b></p>

        <p></p>Sakura made her acting debut in the movie Ano Hito Ano Hi in 2011. That year, she joined the Japanese idol group HKT48 as a first generation trainee. She was promoted to a full member of HKT48 Team H in 2012 and transferred to HKT48 Team KIV in 2014. After being with the group for 10 years, Sakura officially graduated on June 27, 2021.

        <p></p>Sakura, Kim Chae-won and Huh Yun-jin participated in the reality competition series Produce 48 in 2018. Yunjin represented Pledis Entertainment, which at the time was not owned by Hybe Corporation, Source Music's parent company, while Chaewon represented Woollim Entertainment. After finishing in second and tenth place, respectively, Sakura and Chaewon were named to the final lineup of the show's project girl group Iz*One, promoting as members until its disbandment on April 29, 2021. Yunjin finished in 26th place and was eliminated in episode 11.

        <p></p>Prior to joining the group, Kazuha trained as a professional ballerina. After passing an audition, she was personally scouted by Big Hit Music founder Bang Si-hyuk during her studies at Dutch National Ballet Academy in the Netherlands. Kazuha also previously attended the Bolshoi Academy in Moscow, Russia and the Royal Ballet School in the United Kingdom. She cited South Korean girl group Blackpink as her inspiration to transition from ballet to K-pop.

        <p></p>Hong Eun-chae was a student at Def Dance School for two years. She previously auditioned for JYP Entertainment and Pledis Entertainment before joining Source Music in 2021.
